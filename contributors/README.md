#Contributors
When you're making contributions to projects all over GitHub and they like to show everyone what you're doing. Whenever you commit to a project's default branch or the gh-pages branch, open an issue, or propose a Pull Request, GitHub will count that as a contribution.

### Why contribute to open source projects?

There are many great reasons to contribute to open source projects:
    It builds your resume by demonstrating that you can collaborate with others on code.
    It gives you practice with Git and GitHub, which is a valuable data science skill.
    It helps you to build relationships in the open source community.
    It feels good to give back to a project that you use!
